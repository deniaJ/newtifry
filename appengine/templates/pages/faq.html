<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>Is there an iOS version?</h2>

<p>No, not currently. You're welcome to write one. The server side code should have more than enough
	hooks to be able to code in support for an iOS version. None of the development team own
	any Apple hardware, so there has been no incentive to write one at this time.</p>

<h2>Why can't I see messages from more than 24 hours ago?</h2>

<p>All messages older than 24 hours are automatically deleted from the system. Notifry is only intended
	to let users know something is wrong. It's not intended to be a historical reference for notifications.
	Please use the normal systems you would use in your own systems to record a permanent record of
	notifications; for example, email.</p>

<h2>Can I run my own Newtifry?</h2>

<p>Yes, you can. All the code is under an Apache2 licence. So you could checkout and build your
	own version of the system.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/thunderace/newtifry">Notifry Github repository</a> which has the full source code available.
	You will need your own Google authentication details and GCM signup to be able to send notifications to a phone.</p>

<h2>I've found a bug, who should I tell? Or, I want a new feature?</h2>

<p>Lodge an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/thunderace/newtifry/issues">Notifry issue tracker</a>.</a>

<h2>I backed up Newtifry with a third party tool, and restored it to a new phone, and now I don't get notifications?</h2>

<p>Newtifry stores the phone's GCM ID in the settings. If you restore the settings onto a new
	phone, it will have the GCM ID for the old phone, and as such, you won't get any notifications
	delivered to your phone.</p>

<p>Newtifry deliberately doesn't use the cloud backup service for this reason. Please don't
	use third party backup programs to backup and restore Newtifry.</p>
